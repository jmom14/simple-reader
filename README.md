# Simple reader

This project is a web EPUB reader, designed to open and read books in the EPUB format directly from your web browser. It was developed with the primary goal of providing a simple and accessible way to enjoy digital books.

The EPUB reader is also created to work with EPUBs generated by my other project, "Stories GPT", which creates personalized stories in EPUB format.
